# SD_card Project

This project's goal was to become more familiar with the SD memory storage. This consists of making an ASCII art grapher, obtaining the drawings from
of matrices created with characters previously stored in the SD memory.
The user must chose the file to deploy from the console, next it was displayed on console using the pre-recorded characters.
